<!--✨The <thead> HTML element defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table.
✨If the table includes a <thead> block, the <tbody> block must come after it.
✨If you use <tbody>, you can't also have table rows (<tr> elements) which are direct children of the <table> but not included inside the <tbody>. All non-header and non-footer rows must be inside the <tbody> if one is used.
✨You may use more than one <tbody> per table as long as they are all consecutive. This lets you divide the rows in large tables into sections, each of which may be separately formatted if so desired.
✨The <tfoot> HTML element defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table.
✨Browsers can use these elements to enable scrolling of the table body independently of the header and footer. Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.-->

By supplying a <caption> element whose value clearly and concisely describes the table's purpose, it helps the people decide if they need to read the rest of the table content or skip over it. -->
