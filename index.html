Heyy, I'm Megha. I've lived for 17 years on this planet so far.I'm a really compassionate person like i feel for people a lot. I'm trying my very best to become a better version of myself, recently i started working out(It's hardd U_U ), trying to control my mental chaos, reading books,learning coding and typing.
I prepared for jee but due to some reasons quit it which affected my mental healtha A LOTTTTT (I can't stress this enough.. ugh). I just graduated from high school (btw i come from mathura), that experience was okayish since you know..LOCKDOWN.
I want to become a independent and responsible person and make my family proud of mee (real bad..). Last year, I came out of my bubble of an introvert and started to express myself and talk a hella lott (I'm still really insecure but well we're working on it..).
And hey did I tell you I want to make some really good friends and meet some awesome people(ahh.. god i think i have to improve my english). I overthink a lot, really a lott, so i fear what my future will be and all (so i think i will try meditation). and lastly if you have read till here i'll tell you a secret ;) I'm <small>queer</small>.
